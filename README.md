# NormalSort
Sorting Gaussian-distributed data in near-linear time

The information that a randomized dataset has a Gaussian distribution can be used to produce an efficient sorting algorithm.

* normalsort.py
  * The algorithm itself
* normalsort_profile.py
  * Produces timing information as a function of input set size
* NormalSort.ipynb
  * Display the timing information graphically
